# HOW TO RUN

Run the code:

    $ python main.py

And then type the operation (e.g):

    $ 1 + 1

The return should be the result of the operation (e.g):

    $ 2

Alternatively it is also possible to use a text file to represent the input. To do that,
write the operation on the text file and then run the following code:

    $ python main.py < example.txt
